# lilypond-gtksourceview-syntax
A syntax highlight file for LilyPond 2.24.4 (stable release) for use with GtkSourceView.

It mostly follows the colours used in the documentation at lilypond.org, with a few extra keywords and some other things highlighted differently.

Examples of it in action in the Pluma text editor (palette: Mimiga, also made by me (TODO: add link to mimiga palette repository)):

Header of a regular if big file:

Markup with score inside:

Chord mode, figured bass mode, and some Gregorian notation:

Scheme constructs:

I welcome help, so please report any issues you see or anything that should be highlighted but isn't.

Thank you!
